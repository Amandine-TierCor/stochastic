Group assignments and topic choices will be sent during class. Presentations are organized into tracks with different domains and students will be expected to peer evaluate other presentations in their track. Project presentations should be 15 minutes and include a presentation of the paper topic, an illustrative example, and a contextualization of the work in relationship to other presentations in the same track. When possible, interactive examples in the form of a Jupyter notebook are preferred. Presentations can be either a prepared video or a live presentation online; authors must also be present for follow-up questions. Evaluation \ud83d\udd17 Projects will be evaluated based on the following rubric. Each presentation will be reviewed by one teacher and two other groups; the final grade will be a weighted average of these three grades.
