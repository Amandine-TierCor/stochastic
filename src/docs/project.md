# Project: Train traffic in Flatland

The [Flatland](https://gitlab.aicrowd.com/flatland/flatland) environment is a 2D
gridworld for developing Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning. Through simulating
train networks as agents, this platform allows the development of policies for
the efficient management of dense traffic on complex railway networks. We  use
this platform in a project on neuroevolution.

In this project, students compete in teams of their choice of 1-6 people. They
evolve policies for each train in the environment, either using the same genes
for each agent or different genes. Policy representation, stochastic algorithm,
and agent modelling decisions such as inter-agent communication are all up to
the students. Using a fixed budget of evaluations, students must submit their
results and the corresponding code for final evaluation.

This project will take place in class on 01/12. Students are required to install
the Flatland package beforehand and ensure a python environment capable of
running the baseline scripts. Students are encouraged to explore the Flatland
environment before the 01/12. This project coincides with an open competition on
[AIcrowd](https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/flatland-3) platform with material
prizes. Extra credit will be given to students who make submissions to the
online competition in addition to the class competition.
