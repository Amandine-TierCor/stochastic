## Syllabus

This class covers stochastic methods of optimization, primarily simulated
annealing, evolutionary strategies, and genetic algorithms. The class is 10
hours total and uses HTML presentations and Jupyter notebooks in Python for
exercises. The evaluation for this class is based on quiz responses during the
first three classes and on a final project.
